Fedora Scripts
==================

This repository contains several shell scripts that I have used to make my life more convenient on my Fedora machine. They are presented here mostly for educational purposes. They are licensed under [GNU GPLv3](https://github.com/fusion809/fedora-scripts/blob/master/LICENSE). All the files in this repository with the file extension `.sh` are stored in my `~/Shell` directory. While `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` are stored in my user directory, `~/`.

This repository should be cloned recursively, due to the common-scripts submodule being in it and needing to be initialized for these scripts to work. To clone it recursively run:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/fusion809/fedora-scripts
```

I usually set up these scripts by symlinking the contents to the appropriate location.
